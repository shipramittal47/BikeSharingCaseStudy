# Bike Sharing Case Study
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, 
and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

Company wants to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
This is Linear Regression Modeling for Shared Bikes demand.

- What is the background of your project?
This model helps to identify the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

- What is the dataset that is being used?
It is csv file with shared bike data for case study.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Shared bikes count increase by 0.2504 as year increase.
- Shared bikes count increase by 0.0790 in jun.
- Shared bikes count increase by 0.0839 in may.
- Shared bikes count increase by 0.0829 in september.
- Shared bikes count increase by 0.1549 if windspeed is decreasing.
